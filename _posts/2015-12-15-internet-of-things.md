**What the 'Internet of Things' Means For Small Business**

Get ready for [**the Internet
of Things (IoT)**][0] or face extinction. Again, it may not apply to all
fields, but it certainly does apply to many---and probably more than you think.
So what, exactly, is IoT? IoT is a combination of sensors, networking, and
analytics that can be combined to create greater production efficiency, better
quality of life, and a higher level of automation and reach to literally
billions of consumers through their devices.

IDC, predicts that the worldwide Internet of Things market
will grow to $1.7 trillion in 2020.With the real opportunity in the business
and public sector markets.

About 1.5 billion smartphones, tablets, desktops, and
laptops are sold each year. Yet this represents a small fraction of all
connected devices. Currently, another 200 billion devices or things could be
connected to the Internet, of which 14 billion are already connected. By 2020,
IDC estimates that will soar to 32 billion. IT firm Cisco put the number at
greater than 50 billion by that date.

Most of these devices operate without human interaction, for
example, automatically gathering data from sensors and reporting it to the
operator, business owner or manufacturer. The most obvious examples are
happening at a personal level. People wear fitness bands that communicate with
smartphones and cloud providers.
