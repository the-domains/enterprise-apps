THE ENTERPRISE APPS MARKET IS EXPECTED TO REACH $63 BILLION
BY 2020\.

## **

Lack of Mobilization of
Enterprises **

Take it from the words of the most influential Tech CEO Apples
Tim Cook who says businesses are only scratching the surface with mobility,
claiming most companies aren't taking advantage of the opportunity to transform
how they work.

"When you look at the penetration
of mobile in the enterprise, it's shocking how low it is. It's shocking how
many people haven't gone beyond email, browsing and these sorts of things. "People
aren't going to gain productivity by working extra hours, we're already working
flat out. You have to transform your business and today that means embracing
mobility in a big way. 

"What mobility does, it not only facilitates, but to take
advantage of it in a huge way you need to rethink what you're doing. Companies'
\[current\] mobility strategy is about doing simple things like email, not
reinventing their business "

At CAF we agree entirely with his viewpoint, the mobilization of
enterprises is the single most important challenge for enterprises to address,
we believe we have the experience ,track
record and innovation required to help companies and organisations
build strategy and deliver the creative solutions needed to boost productivity
and competitive edge.
