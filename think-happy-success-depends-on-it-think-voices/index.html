on it. Think “Voices” </h1><h1>The Happiness Factor</h1><p>Let us face it when the
workforce is not happy, productivity will fall and it is a very good indicator
the enterprise has problems. Surprisingly it’s not usually a remuneration issue
or even the difficult market conditions that are the main drivers of their
unhappiness. It is more likely to be the tiring and inefficient business
processes, bad communication and poor customer sales support that are going to
send them over the edge. Add to this poor management decisions and working
conditions and before you know, its rocketing staff turnover, poor sales and
falling productivity. Trust me when I say a happy workforce is a productive
workforce and a productive workforce is usually a profitable enterprise. Thus
it also follows that in today’s fast changing economy a positive and engaged
workforce will help deliver the competitive edge. You do not go to war with an
army that is ready to join the other side and you do not want a business that
can’t identify its weaknesses or rapidly change to marketing conditions. It is
a foolish business leader that cannot recognize that happiness in the workforce
is critical to organizational and market success.</p><p>Research is demonstrating
that as individuals become happier, they are more loyal, compassionate, creative,
energetic, financially successful, emotionally and physically healthy, etc.,
and there cant b​e a better strategy goal than ensuring or improving the
happiness of your workforce. Remember key workers are very expensive to
replace, so paying attention and investing in your happiness factor is not an
option, it is essential. Promoting and investing in happiness in an
organisation is a critical element in building a profitable and efficient
business or organisation.</p><p>What businesses or
organization’s require is to put in place a method to </p><p>take a realistic
assessment of the present, both the bad and the good. They need an easy to use
anonymous reporting solution that enable all employees to measure their
happiness and give them the freedom to tell you how they see the problems and
invite their suggestions of how to improve matters. As a business it is vital to
identify where the problems exist whether they are large or small. Some can be addressed
immediately whether they are production, supply chain, bad data, communication,
sales, process, staffing, marketing, pricing, working conditions, remuneration
etc etc others will require longer term solutions or investment. Some of the feedback
may well be brutal even embarrassing but on the other hand some of it will be
positive and creative leading to productivity and sales gains. </p><p>What’s
is important here is you are sending a very positive and powerful message to
all staff that you are listening and you want to hear from all individuals and
as a company or organisation you are willing to make the changes required to
strengthen and improve both the companies and individuals opportunities and
working environment.</p><p>You need to be able
to measure your progress and set in place a mechanism to react quickly when
issues arise. The information collected and analyzed will contribute with your planning
and budgeting to ensure money is invested where it is needed.</p><p>The goal should be to create a positive environment the
workforce enjoys; you want people to thrive and be happy in their work,
literally fueling them with energy and positive momentum rather than being demotivated.
When leaders create workplaces with these characteristics, their people feel
like they can grow, develop and thrive in their work. You want your employees at
the end of the day to be happy and not depleted with energy for their family
life and hobbies</p><p><b>So how do you
do this?</b></p><p>Building and monitoring and
influencing happiness is not an easy task yet in today’s fast paced mobilized
world strategically it is vital for your organisation to ensure its employees
are happy. CAF have developed an application called Voices, specifically
engineered to address the very challenge of managing and maintaining the
happiness factor. </p><p><b>So what is Voices?</b></p><p>This is a smart enterprise
application that CAF have developed that will enable and address the key issues
in developing and improving the happiness factor for enterprises and organization’s.</p><p>“Voices” is an easy and
scalable application to install which enables spontaneous in the moment
employee feedback, which is open, honest, and succinct. The mobile applications
and feedback dashboard make these insights easy to capture and even easier to
breakdown and use. The Voices application will engage and involve your
colleagues and boost employee satisfaction. It invites all staff to state their
in depth opinion and sends a clear message to them that it matters, its
important and as your employer you will listen and address all the key issues
raised. </p><p>Voices enables your business
to gather genuine unbiased feedback from your employees, providing you with the
success data you need to make impactful change, and improving your employees’
happiness for the better.</p><p>This permission to feedback
and vent makes employees happier and more empowered. It provides you with a
playful and engaging user interface to ensure it is easy for employees to
submit their feedback.</p><p>You can choose whether to
collate your employees’ feedback and sentiment each week, or month and
notifications will automatically remind your employees to submit their
feedback. Feedback takes an anonymous rating from 1 to 10 and free-form
comments.</p><p>You have the ability to
optionally ask your employees for additional data so that you can filter down
feedback to groups of related individuals and identify problem areas early.</p><p>You can create up to four
customisable filter categories using the simplified admin portal and choose as
many options in each category as you need to suit your business needs.</p><p>The management dashboard
gives you instant, actionable insight and effortless configuration and by using
the graphs you can check the progress of your initiatives over time and make
informed decisions quickly.</p><p>You can gather insights by viewing the
breakdown of the comments and get the low-down on what people are saying and
how they feel. Filters also allow you to break down data by the categories that
matter the most to your business.</p><p>Installing new applications or work
methodology normally carries with it risk married to costs, yet the good news
is CAF’s Voices enterprise application which can be installed within a few
days, has fractional costs and virtually negligible risk, so is it not time to
find ​out just how happy your people are.</p><p>In addition to the benefits of
powerful engagement that Voices delivers, the real management challenge is how
the enterprise or business unit responds and acts upon the issues raised. Our
very own experience week after week provides us with the business intelligence
required to better navigate our success and build a very happy company. </p><p>To get more information and your free
