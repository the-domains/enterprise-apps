            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>“Think happy” Success depends
on it. Think “Voices” </h1><h2>The Happiness Factor</h2><p>Let us face it when the
workforce is not happy, productivity will fall and it is a very good indicator
the enterprise has problems. Surprisingly it’s not usually a remuneration issue
or even the difficult market conditions that are the main drivers of their
unhappiness. It is more likely to be the tiring and inefficient business
processes, bad communication and poor customer sales support that are going to
send them over the edge. Add to this poor management decisions and working
conditions and before you know, its rocketing staff turnover, poor sales and
falling productivity. Trust me when I say a happy workforce is a productive
workforce and a productive workforce is usually a profitable enterprise. Thus
it also follows that in today’s fast changing economy a positive and engaged
workforce will help deliver the competitive edge. You do not go to war with an
army that is ready to join the other side and you do not want a business that
can’t identify its weaknesses or rapidly change to marketing conditions. It is
a foolish business leader that cannot recognize that happiness in the workforce
is critical to organizational and market success.</p></article>]]></description>
